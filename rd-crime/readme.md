## Overview
RD-Crime is a sophisticated script for FiveM servers using the QB-Core framework. It introduces an immersive headbag and ziptie system, allowing players to restrain others and limit their sensory input, adding a new layer of roleplay possibilities to your server.

## Features
- Fully functional headbag system
- Realistic ziptie mechanics
- Configurable options for different target and inventory systems
- Support for multiple HUD systems
- Easy to use with QB-Target or OX-Target integration
- Customizable blacklist for jobs

## Dependencies

## Installation
1. Download the `rd-crime` folder and place it in your server's `resources` directory.
2. Add `ensure rd-crime` to your server.cfg file.
3. Configure the `config.lua` file to match your server's setup.
4. Restart your server.

## Configuration
In the `config.lua` file, you can customize:
- Target system (QB-Target or OX-Target)
- Inventory system (QS-Inventory, QB-Inventory, or OX-Inventory)
- HUD system (CRM-HUD or QB-HUD)
